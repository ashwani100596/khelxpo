 <h2 style="font-size:2.5vw">Getting Ready</h2>
 <p class="text-justify">In sprints athletes take crouch position and in longer races, athletes should start the race from standing position. Here no starting blocks are used. They take respective positions in the lane before the starting line, when they hear on your marks call.<br>
 During sprint races, the ‘set’ position is taken on the next call, firmly placing feet on starting blocks and taking crouch position. For the 800-meter race, athletes start from staggered starting points.<br></p>
<h3 style="font-size:2.5vw">How to Play</h3>
<p>
1.Runners occupy respective positions in call.<br>
2.They start once they hear the starting gunshot.<br>
3.The race finishes when any part of the athletes body crosses the vertical plane of the finish line.<br></p>

<h4>Winning a Race</h4>
<p>Each race is divided into various lavels and each lavel may be held in many heats to accommodate all athletes.<br>
The contesting athletes’ records are considered while dividing athletes among heats. It is done so that the most successful athletes reach the final lavel.<br>
Usually two to three top performers from each race will be consider for the next lavel.<br>
The one who reaches the finish line first in the final is the winner.<br>

<h5>The runners should abide by the following rules in order to complete a race −</h5><br>
1.Sprinters should run in designated lanes and cannot cross lanes, throughout the race.<br>
2.In races with bunched starts, athletes can break inside. In 800-meter race, they start from staggered positions and can break inside after the first bend.<br>
3.Sprinters shouldn’t step on white lines that mark their lanes throughout the race.<br>
4.Sensors are placed in the starting pistol and at the blocks. In case of a false start, the athlete is disqualified.<br>
5.Before giving the ‘set’ command or before firing the starter gun, athletes cannot touch the other side of the start line with their hands or feet.<br>
6.Athletes should not obstruct other athletes during the race.<br>
7.If an athlete is obstructed, the referee may order the race to be held again, or he may ask the athlete to take part in the next round.<br>
8.Athletes may leave the track voluntarily before the race ends, but they cannot come back to the track else they will be disqualified.<br><br></p>
